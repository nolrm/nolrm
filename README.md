### Welcome to my website!

### stacks

* NodeJS
* Jekyll
* SASS

### Getting Started

I built this to run on NodeJS (when i decided to move it out of git pages) but for now everything is compiled in jekyll and run on NodeJS. Compass is used to compile css.

1. npm start (start reading the compiled jekyll)
2. cd application
3. jekyll build --watch
4. cd **your-directory-name**/source/mcmaniti
5. compass watch
6. do not forget to access localhost:5005
7. change settings as you like
